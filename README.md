# SFERD

## Official Code for paper: "Reducing Spatial Fitting Error in Distillation of Denoising Diffusion Models"
## Abstract
We propose **S**patial **F**itting-**E**rror **R**eduction **D**istillation model ($\textbf{SFERD}$). SFERD utilizes attention guidance from the teacher model and a designed semantic gradient predictor to reduce the student's fitting error. Empirically, our proposed model facilitates high-quality sample generation in a few function evaluations (2~4 steps).

## Requirements
A suitable conda environment named SFERD can be created and activated with:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate SFERD
```
